# the leah project
## a fully customized D&D character sheet (for a homebrewed fighter/barbarian, for those in the know)
see current live iteration at: https://olivia-lilit.github.io/leah/
#### current features:
* dynamically calculates and writes score modifiers and stat modifiers and saves
* allows live calculation of hit points, with alerts when the character falls unconscious or insta-dies
* provides checkboxes for use of limited daily resources such as rage and superiority dice
* allows notation of gun rounds, bullet quantities, and coinage 

#### eventual goals:
* given 6 key stats, profiencies, and modifying items: calculate skill, attack, and damage modifiers, auto-roll dice and add modifiers for all skills, allow toggling of stat scores based on status effects (eg haste or exhaustion)
* display extended explanations of complex items/conditions upon hover/click (with nice display)
* require authentication to modify
* allow sessions to be saved and resumed at a later date
* have drag and drop functionality for loading bullets with different capabilities into two different guns, auto-decrementing the bullet count when doing so
* display damage calculation for "last shot" with an option to auto-roll dice
